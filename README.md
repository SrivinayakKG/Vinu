To predict the hospital discharge cost. To analyze the hospital discharge cost TOTCHG as mentioned in the data set and the affect of all other factors which influence the overall hospital discharge cost. The Final analysis will reveal all the significant variable which play a pivotal role is attaining the Hospital Discharge Cost. The Dependent variable in this data set is ‘TOTCHG’ or the total Hospital discharge costs as it he variable whose values are to be predicted with the model. Since the dependent variable is of continues form we will use the Linear Regression Model in the project. All the other variables like ‘Age’, ‘Female’, ‘Los’ (Length of Stay), ‘Race’, ‘Aprdrg’ (All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups) are the independent variables as they will influence the value of the dependent variable ‘TOTCHG’.
